# Social Media Integration Guidelines

## Platform Abstraction

- Create platform-agnostic interfaces for social media operations
- Implement platform-specific adapters
- Use dependency injection for platform services
- Document platform-specific requirements and limitations
- Implement feature detection for platform capabilities

## Twitter API Integration (Phase 1)

- Use Twitter API v2 for all interactions
- Implement proper OAuth2 authentication
- Handle rate limits with exponential backoff
- Cache API responses when appropriate
- Log all API interactions
- Implement webhook handlers for real-time events

## Future Platform Integrations

- LinkedIn API
- Facebook Graph API
- Instagram Graph API
- Buffer API (optional)

## Authentication

- Use OAuth2 for all platform authentication
- Store tokens securely
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Handle authentication failures gracefully
- Provide clear user feedback for authentication issues

## Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limit tracking for each platform
- Use queuing for high-volume operations
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Prioritize critical operations
- Monitor rate limit usage

## Content Posting

- Validate content against platform-specific requirements
- Handle media uploads properly
- Support scheduled posting
- Implement retry logic for failed posts
- Track posting success/failure
- Support post editing and deletion where available

## Content Retrieval

- Implement efficient pagination for timeline retrieval
- Cache frequently accessed content
- Support filtering and search
- Handle API changes gracefully
- Normalize data across platforms

## Analytics

- Track engagement metrics across platforms
- Implement platform-specific analytics
- Normalize metrics for cross-platform comparison
- Generate insights from engagement data
- Support custom reporting periods

## Error Handling

- Implement platform-specific error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Alert on critical errors
