# API Design

## RESTful Principles

- Use resource-oriented design
- Use appropriate HTTP methods:
  - GET for retrieving resources
  - POST for creating resources
  - PUT for updating resources
  - DELETE for removing resources
  - PATCH for partial updates
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Use plural nouns for resource collections
- Use versioned API routes (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`)

## Request/Response Format

- Use JSON for request and response bodies
- Use camelCase for JSON property names
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for request/response validation
- Implement proper error handling with consistent error responses
- Include pagination for collection endpoints
- Support filtering, sorting, and searching where appropriate

## Authentication and Authorization

- Use JWT for authentication
- Implement role-based access control
- Use OAuth2 for social media platform authentication
- Secure all endpoints with appropriate authorization
- Include rate limiting for all endpoints

## Documentation

- Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include example requests and responses
- Document authentication requirements
- Document error responses
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Versioning

- Use URL versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`)
- Maintain backward compatibility within a version
- Deprecate old versions with appropriate notice
- Document breaking changes between versions

## Performance

- Implement caching for frequently accessed resources
- Use pagination for large collections
- Optimize database queries
- Use compression for responses
- Monitor and optimize response times

## Security

- Validate all input data
- Sanitize output data to prevent XSS
- Implement CORS policies
- Use HTTPS for all API traffic
- Protect against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

## Testing

- Write integration tests for all endpoints
- Test happy paths and error cases
- Test performance under load
- Test security vulnerabilities
- Test with real-world data scenarios
