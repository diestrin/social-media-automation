# Testing Approach

This document outlines the testing approach for the API application.

## Testing Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions and classes in isolation. They are located in the same directory as the code being tested with a `.spec.ts` suffix.

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly. These are also located in the same directory as the code being tested with a `.spec.ts` suffix, but they test interactions between components.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests verify the entire application flow from start to finish. They are located in the `test` directory with an `.e2e-spec.ts` suffix.

```bash
# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Performance Tests

Performance tests measure the system's performance under load. They are located in the `test/performance` directory with a `.perf-spec.ts` suffix.

```bash
# Run performance tests
npm run test:perf
```

## Test Structure

All tests follow the AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the test data and conditions
2. **Act**: Perform the action being tested
3. **Assert**: Verify the results

## Test Utilities

### Factories

Test data factories are located in the `test/factories` directory. They provide methods to create test data for unit and integration tests.

### Mocks

Mock implementations for external dependencies are located in the `test/mocks` directory.

### Helpers

Test helper functions are located in the `test/helpers` directory.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (unit, e2e, performance)
npm run test:all

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:cov

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests in CI mode
npm run test:ci
```

## Test Coverage

We aim for at least 80% code coverage. Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage` directory.

## Best Practices

1. Keep tests fast and independent
2. Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
3. One assertion per test when possible
4. Test both success and failure cases
5. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
6. Use factories for test data
7. Clean up test data after tests
8. Mock external dependencies in unit tests
